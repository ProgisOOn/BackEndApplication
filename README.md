# BackEndApplication
My back-end application. It seems slightly crazzy because I've tried lots of instruments here just to touch.

I've used Fast API with Redis, Celery, Flower, fastapi-users, fastapi-cache2

I've opened two databases in docker with docker-compose, becomed familiar with volumes and pgAdmin for all of it 

Known what alembic is, SQLAlchemy and that's it for this time, it is not that hard as I thought, but I faced enough problems of course
